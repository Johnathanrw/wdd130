    <p>Hi I am Johnathan as this has shown and I am here to tell you a little about myself. I an 22 and the oldest kid
        in my family. I currently work at an internet company.
        With that in mind I find the idea of understandign web develpoment interesting since it is the other side of
        what I do already. My job though does include web hosting.
        Other than that I live in Utah and enjoy playing games as long as I am not fixing the internet to do so.
    </p>
